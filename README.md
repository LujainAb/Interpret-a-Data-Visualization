# Interpret-a-Data-Visualization
In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard about the top ranked skills in 2016 to uncover insights. In this repo is a short report explaining each insight, and how I found the information for my conclusions.



This is the first project in the Business Analytics Nanodegree by Udacity


To derive insgihts yourself, go to Matt Chamber's [LinkedIn Top Skills 2016 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matt.chambers/viz/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday)


##  Emerging Trends

Both Cloud & Distributed Computing and Statistical Analysis & Data Mining have been equally ranked 1 by seven countries.  Since these two skills complement each other (ex, storing large amounts of data in the cloud to later use it and derive insights from it using data science techniques). When I clicked the top two skills, I noticed that multiple countries ranked them as the most in demand skills (Number 1). With this insight we can conclude that Data science is an emerging trend as seen on the dashboard.



##  Visionary Countries

Australia, Ireland, and United States were the top 3 countries to go with the flow alongside the global trends. When I clicked on these countries, they had the most blue-colored dots, which means that these three countries had ranked most skills in the same rank as the global average ranks or even higher.



##  Missed Opportunities

By clicking on Data presentation I noticed that it did not make the cut in the top 10 skills in most countries, except United Kingdom. Which is a surprising insight since Statistical Analysis & Data Mining is highly demanded. The other countries need to realize the importance of data presentation as it goes along with data mining and data science.
